# PyTable Analyzer | Zensar

A web application developed by Zensar Technologies that analyzes Python and Shell scripts to identify PyTable tables and fields, organized by file and folder structure.

## Features

- **Analyze Entire Folders**: Recursively scan directories for Python and Shell scripts
- **Upload Individual Files**: Analyze specific Python (.py) and Shell (.sh, .bash) files
- **Direct Code Input**: Paste code directly into the application for analysis
- **Folder Organization**: Results are organized by folder structure for better navigation
- **Search & Filter**: Search through tables and fields to find specific information
- **Download Results**: Export analysis results as JSON for further processing

## What It Analyzes

The PyTable Analyzer scans your code for:

- PyTable table definitions and declarations
- Table fields and their types
- Relationships between tables
- Temporary vs. persistent tables

## How It Works

The analyzer parses your code using Python's abstract syntax tree (AST) module and regular expressions to identify PyTable-specific patterns, including:

- Table definitions using `createTable` calls
- Field definitions in `IsDescription` subclasses
- Table references in code
- Table operations and queries

## Supported PyTable Patterns

```python
# Table creation
table = h5file.createTable(group, 'sensors', SensorDescription)

# Table definition
class SensorDescription(IsDescription):
    timestamp = Int64Col()
    value = FloatCol()
    location = StringCol(16)

# Table operations
for row in table.iterrows():
    print(row['value'])
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Additional dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Method 1: Using Git

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytable-analyzer.git
   cd pytable-analyzer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   # Or if you prefer to use the requirements file
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Download

1. Download the ZIP file of this project from GitHub
2. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to that directory
4. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies as shown in steps 2-3 above

### Method 3: Using Docker (Optional)

If you prefer using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t pytable-analyzer .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 pytable-analyzer
   ```

### Configuration

1. (Optional) Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   set SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key

   # On macOS/Linux
   export SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

2. If no secret key is provided, a default development key will be used (not recommended for production)

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   # Make sure your virtual environment is activated
   python main.py
   
   # Alternatively, use Flask directly
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
   
   # Or with gunicorn in production
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

### Analyzing Code

3. Choose one of the three analysis methods:
   - **Analyze Folder**: Enter a path to recursively scan for Python and Shell scripts
     - Example: `/path/to/your/project`
     - The analyzer will walk through all subdirectories
     - Only `.py`, `.sh`, and `.bash` files will be analyzed
   
   - **Upload Files**: Select one or more files to upload and analyze
     - You can select multiple files by holding Ctrl/Cmd while selecting
     - Maximum upload size is 16MB total
   
   - **Paste Code**: Input code directly into the text area
     - Useful for quick analysis of code snippets
     - Enter a filename with appropriate extension (.py/.sh) to help with parsing

4. Configure analysis options:
   - Choose whether to exclude temporary tables
   - This helps focus on persistent data structures

5. Click "Analyze Code" to process the files and view the results

### Working with Results

6. View results organized by folder structure
   - Files are grouped by their directory
   - Tables are listed under each file
   - Fields are displayed in a table format

7. Use the search functionality to filter tables and fields
   - Search for specific table names or field types
   - Results update dynamically as you type

8. Download the results as JSON for further processing or integration with other tools

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission errors when analyzing folders:
  - Ensure the application has read access to the specified directory
  - Try using absolute paths instead of relative paths
  
- For large codebases:
  - Consider analyzing specific subfolders rather than the entire project
  - Increase the timeout settings if needed
